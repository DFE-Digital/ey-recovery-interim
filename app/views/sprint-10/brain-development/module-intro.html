            Brain development and how children learn
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">On completion of this module you will be able to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>establish and explore the stages of children’s brain development</li>
            <li>explore the impact of brain development on children’s holistic development</li>
            <li>examine the connection between brain development and children’s learning</li>
            <li>explore a range of theories underpinning best practice</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">From birth to 5 years old, a child’s brain develops more than at any other point in life. 
            Brain development is a long process. The brain starts to develop around 2 weeks after conception and continues into adulthood.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">It's important to understand developmental patterns and factors that can affect a child’s development. Both 
            genetic and environmental factors impact on brain development.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Brain development is integral to a child’s ability to develop their language skills. As communication and language 
            will underpin all other areas of development, it is essential that we promote both brain and communication development.</p>
