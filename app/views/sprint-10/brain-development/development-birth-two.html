            Brain development from 0 to 2 years old
          </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">The most significant growth for a child’s brain happens between birth and 2 years of age. A 2 year old’s brain is three-quarters of its adult size.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The early years are the period where more and more connections develop in the brain, resulting in the child being able to carry out more complex tasks. 
          They are therefore a crucial period of opportunity for the child’s development to be shaped by experience, environment and opportunity.</p>
