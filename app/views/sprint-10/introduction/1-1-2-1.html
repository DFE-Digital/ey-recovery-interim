          <img src="/public/images/block-hand.jpg" alt="">

          <p class="govuk-body">The long standing debate of nature versus nurture questions whether aspects of children’s development and behaviour are influenced more by biological (nature) or environmental (nurture) influences.   </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">The debate raises questions including: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>how do we become the person we are? </li>
            <li>are we born pre programmed to develop in a certain way despite environmental influences? </li>
            <li>to what extent will our experiences and opportunities shape us? </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">The children in your care will experience a broad range of influences that could potentially shape their learning and development. Some examples could include: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>adverse experiences including violence and abuse  </li>
            <li>physical factors including housing conditions  </li>
            <li>financial factors  - determining access to resources, activities and experiences   </li>
            <li>exposure and access to physical activity, adequate sleep and a healthy diet   </li>
            <li>family beliefs and culture  </li>
            <li>exposure to social interaction and communication   </li>
            <li>specialised knowledge - for example many children will know about dinosaurs because their parents or carers have shared this with them  </li>
            <li>having English as a second language  </li>
            <li>medical conditions or illnesses resulting in prolonged periods of missed learning   </li>
            <li>the impact of stereotypical views and discrimination   </li>
            <li>the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  </li>

          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">Your role is to ensure that any potential influences don’t become barriers and to ensure that every child has access to all learning and development opportunities. </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">A robust understanding of children’s expected development will further support you to ensure that the choices you make as a practitioner and the quality of the environment that children experience will support children to progress and succeed. </p>
