          <p class="govuk-body">Some children with access to technology may have played with number related apps and games.  They may also have been involved in practical activities such as cookery requiring them to weigh and measure.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Children may have had access to toys, games and jigsaws that require problem solving and matching. They may have explored mathematical concepts such as time, shape and distance through interactions with their parents or carers.   </p>

            Negative impact
          </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children may not have had access to toys, games or learning experiences that supported their mathematical understanding. A lack of social interaction may have resulted in limited opportunities to explore mathematical concepts such as time, shape and distance.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some parents may have a limited understanding of how to support their child with maths and what their child should be learning. They may have avoided this subject and focused on other activities.  </p>
