          <p class="govuk-body">Some children with increased exposure to technology will have developed new skills. Children with access to the outdoors, creative materials and imaginary play will have used their imagination and creativity.   </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Children may have had increased opportunities to listen to music, sing, dance or participate in other creative activities with parents and carers or siblings. As a result they may have developed new skills.    </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children will have had limited exposure to dance, music and art. Children with limited or no access to creative materials, role play items or musical activity may have limited skills and development in these areas.  </p>
