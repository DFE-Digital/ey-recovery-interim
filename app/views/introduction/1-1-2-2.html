          <p class="govuk-body">Every child’s experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have been different. It is likely that different areas of a child’s development may have been impacted positively or negatively during this time.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">You will also need to consider how characteristics of a child’s environment may have further magnified this impact. For example, some children will have had limited access to technology, books, outdoor space and a varied diet.  </p>
