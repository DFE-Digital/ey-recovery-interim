            How improved child development knowledge supports outstanding practice: understanding behaviour
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Children can display challenging behaviour for a broad variety of reasons including:  </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>being hungry </li>
            <li>feeling unwell </li>
            <li>feeling tired </li>
            <li>learning difficulties or disabilities</li>
            <li>not knowing the unspoken rules of friendly, respectful behaviour</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">The learning environment can also offer potential triggers for unwanted behaviour. Your knowledge of child development will help you to avoid, minimise and resolve such incidents.    </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Communication issues </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">If instructions, activities and experiences are not tailored to a child’s needs or communication level, they may become frustrated. You can use your knowledge of child development to apply suitable strategies to avoid such frustrations and reduce lost learning time. </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Unsuitable activities and experiences </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">If a child is not challenged by their environment, or feels a task is too difficult, they may want to avoid it and involve themselves in an alternative task. This may be unproductive or disruptive to others. You should provide a stage appropriate environment with managed risk and calculated challenge.  </p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Inconsistency </h2>

          <p class="govuk-body">For effective learning to take place children need to experience consistency regarding boundaries, routines and key people. These strategies need to be deployed to meet the child’s level of communication and cognitive skills to reap maximum benefits. A child who feels secure and understood will be free to explore and learn.  </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Furthering your understanding of how patterns of development can influence the way children build relationships, develop their confidence and respond to strategies will help you support them by encouraging positive behaviour and promoting successful learning environments. </p>
