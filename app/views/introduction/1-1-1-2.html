          <p class="govuk-body">When you are planning your curriculum, you need to consider the intent, implementation and impact. </p>

          
          <div class="information">
            <p class="govuk-body">"Intent is what you want pupils to learn: your curriculum thinking and high-level planning. </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Implementation is the teaching activities you choose to teach your curriculum. </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">Impact is when that curriculum content is learned."</p>

          </div>

          <p class="govuk-body">When doing this planning, you need to consider each child’s:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>level of skill, knowledge and understanding </li>
            <li>needs for successful learning to take place </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">While all the children in your group may be of a similar age, this does not mean they will be at the same developmental level. You will need to call upon your knowledge of child development to consider different levels of secure knowledge and understanding.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Some children may be in need of additional care, instruction and support, because of missing out on prior experiences. You’ll need to adapt your practice accordingly to ensure that these children  receive the adult help needed to develop.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">You may need to differentiate activities to make an experience more simple, or adapt it to ensure that all members of the group are sufficiently challenged.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Combining your professional judgment and knowledge of child development will help you to plan and put in place an early years curriculum that:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>promotes inclusion and progress for all</li>
            <li>reduces unnecessary barriers to learning</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Practitioner prompt</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">Take a moment to think about the children you care for and pick a specific age group.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Note down a physical activity you would frequently offer. Now consider how you would provide this activity for 3 different levels of experience all at the same time. What do you need to consider?</p>
          </div>

          <p class="govuk-body">Using your child development knowledge will help you to measure the impact of your intentions - has the child successfully learnt what you intended them to learn? Children need opportunities to reinforce their knowledge and learning. This ensures that they are secure in their level of understanding before being challenged to progress.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Your knowledge of child development will support you to assess the correct secure age and stage for the child. It will also help you to offer the correct learning environment, experiences and opportunities to support their progress.</p>
