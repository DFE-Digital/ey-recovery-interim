<p>You have learned about child led activity in previous modules. Sometimes this will be play initiated by the child from the start, sometimes it will be an activity that was adult initiated and then the child chooses or leads next steps.</p>

<p>Child led activity can give children freedom to explore, try things out for themselves and to feel the satisfication of being able to make and apply their own choices and decisions. This can bring the wonders of new and unfamiliar experiences, and the fun, practice or predictability of engaging in activities that the child already knows they enjoy.</p>

<p>You will need to plan your curriculum, activities and environment to give children opportunitities to explore and find what interests, surprises and excites them. You should identify opportunities to respond warmly to children’s self-initiated play and to extend learning by following their lead and being responsive to their ideas.</p>

<p>For babies, child led activities could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treasure baskets</li>
  <li>push or pull along toys</li>
  <li>a wide variety of sensory items, such as textured books, musical instruments or baby rattles</li>
  <li>opportunities to lie down and roll</li>
  <li>opportunities to reach for hanging items, such as toys dangling on a baby gym, to promote movement, grabbing, pushing, and pulling</li>
  <li>stackable equipment, such as rings or blocks</li>
</ul>

<p>For toddlers and older children child led activities could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>access to equipment to build their own outdoor obstacle course, such as cones or ramps</li>
  <li>a mark making table or painting station</li>
  <li>role play clothes with a variety of fasteners</li>
  <li>materials for construction activities, such as making craft models or building with wooden blocks</li>
  <li>puzzles</li>
  <li>modelling materials, such as clay, plasticine and dough</li>
  <li>water, sand and messy play materials, such as gloop and foam</li>
  <li>items to thread, such as beads or pasta shapes</li>
</ul>

<p>Children must always be supervised when taking part in these activities.</p>

</div></div>
<p>All of the activities that have been listed as child led can also be used as adult led activities. This is because you can scaffold the children’s learning as needed.</p>

    <div class="govuk-details__text key-concept">
        Scaffolding learning is a technique where, as a practitioner, you support and guide children’s learning, building on the starting point of what they already know. As the child learns and becomes more confident, you should gradually reduce support. The child will then have built the knowledge and skills to complete the task alone.
    </div>
  </details>

<p>For example, an obstacle course has been listed in both the adult and child led ideas. You might begin by planning an obstacle course to specifically help a child to improve their balance and coordination and you will guide the child throughout the obstacle course.</p>

<p>You can do this by demonstrating how to place one foot in front of the other on the beam or how to jump and land on both feet. The next time you help the child you might use prompts to ask them “do you remember how to place your feet to balance on the beam?”</p>

<p>After the child has developed the necessary skills you might watch from further away. Eventually the child may create the course themselves or join in with no adult support. This has now become a child led activity that they can use to continue to master their skills.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reflection point</h2>
<div class="gem-c-govspeak">
<p>Reflect on what you have read about balancing adult and child led activities for physical development.</p>

<p>Think about the activities that you planned for a recent day in your setting.</p>

<p>Consider the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What opportunities did the activities include for children to develop their physical skills?</li>
  <li>Did children use their physical skills naturally, or because you specifically planned opportunities for them to do so?</li>
  <li>How could you develop your planning to extend or improve on these activities?</li>
</ul>
