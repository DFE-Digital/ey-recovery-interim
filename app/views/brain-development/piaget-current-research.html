          <p class="govuk-body">Large numbers of studies and experiments were carried out to support Piaget’s work and positively reinforced his findings.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">However, more recent research also shows some criticisms and questions regarding Piaget’s work.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Examples have been documented of babies having the ability to show surprise and look for things that have disappeared from their environment, suggesting that they can have the expectation that an object continues to exist even though they can no longer see it. </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">This would suggest that babies and young children have some ability to form abstract thoughts which is contradictory to Piaget’s previous thoughts.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Piaget’s research was also criticised for not taking into account a wide variety of socio-economic factors within the environment as much of his research was conducted with children of well educated professionals.   </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Current research believes that babies and young children learn through a combination of sensorimotor activities like using their senses to explore their environment and the opportunity to build upon previous experiences and opportunities. </p>
